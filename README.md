naming: all underscores for separating.  if hyphens used, they will be replaced
element seeking:
- Css_Selectors: #id_name, <element>.<CLASS_NAME>, <element> <sub_element>.<CLASS_NAME>, [<attribute_name> = <attribute value]
- Xpath: in the rare cases that one of the above doesn't work, an xpath is acceptable if it is as concise and local as possible (i.e. no more than one or two nodes deep)

Text entry
- if text entry leads to dropdown, best practice is to add postText:'Enter' before subsequent clicking
